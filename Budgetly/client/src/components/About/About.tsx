          <h2>The Budgetly Journey</h2>
          <p>
            Budgetly was founded in 2020 with a simple mission: to make personal finance management accessible, intuitive, and effective for everyone. Our founder, Sarah Johnson, had spent years as a financial advisor and noticed that many of her clients struggled with the same challenges - tracking expenses, sticking to budgets, and planning for the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            She realized that existing financial apps were either too complex, too basic, or too focused on investing rather than everyday financial management. There was a clear gap in the market for a solution that combined powerful financial tools with an intuitive, user-friendly interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, Budgetly has grown into a comprehensive financial management platform used by thousands of individuals and families worldwide. We continue to innovate and expand our features based on user feedback and the latest advancements in financial technology.
